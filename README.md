# Solo Super EE No Nav Required
Updated script to fix Die Rise NAV bug

Made for me and other people that were hinderd by the bug:  
https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/15569/navcard-tables-broken-anyone?_=1643811325947

**Note:**
You still have to complete all three EE maps for rictofen or maxis.

**Note:**
If there are no lights displayed on the Easter Egg Tracker Box, pick up a different Nav card next time playing buried.  
This is also somehow part of the bug.  
This should make the Box work again.  

**Credits:**
The original script was made by Rebelhero.  
I only changed the things that were necessary to start the super ee without NAV requirements.
